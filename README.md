# Cors bypass proxy
# Server Configuration

This repository contains a server configuration that allows you to run a server locally and proxy requests to a remote endpoint. It utilizes Node.js and several packages to achieve this functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before running the server, ensure that you have the following packages installed in your project:

- Express
- CORS
- http-proxy-middleware

You can install these packages using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
npm install express cors http-proxy-middleware


Running the Server
To run the server on your local machine, follow these steps:

Make sure you have installed the required packages as mentioned above.
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.
Execute the following command:

node server.js

Once the server is running, it will listen on port 3000 of your local machine.

Proxying Requests
When the server is running, you can make a request to http://localhost:3000/sdapi/v1/img2img, and it will be proxied to https://pyy7zm1qnwzcs1-3000.proxy.runpod.net/sdapi/v1/img2img.

Please note that the proxying functionality is provided by the http-proxy-middleware package, which is installed as a prerequisite.
